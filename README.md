# oneFileHoster
A quick ansible practice.

The task ahead:

Create an ansible playbook that installs an NGINX server then does it's configuration as necessary to be able to host a single file. Hence the name, oneFileHoster.
The solution (as far as I see the playbook itself) should be shared through GitHub.

Evalution details:

The goal of this task os to check how I am going to absorb an unknown topic through a quick task to complete.
The most important checks are to commit often, with messages that are elaborate and explanationary about what was being done in that commit and why.
